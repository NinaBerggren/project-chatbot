This week we are building a ChatBot in pairs using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
We make a chat functionality where you can interact with a "waiter" in Wildebeest Burger.

Some of the learnings this week:
- Practise JavaScript variables, datatypes, functions and conditionals
- Injecting HTML using JavaScript by manipulating the DOM


<!-- Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point. -->

## The problem

We started the project with a general flowchart of how the interactions were gonna go, and then built the JavaScript code around it. 
To individualize CSS for our project, we made new bot and user icons and we made a color scheme from the chosen background image.
Each function starts with a bot answer, and ends with calling on the next functionality using setTimeout
